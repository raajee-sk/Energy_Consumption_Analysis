# Energy Consumption Analysis With PowerBI


### **Problem Statement :**
  Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations,
  leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint 
  areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.
 


### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!
- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- matplotlib, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)


### Workflow :

#### Step 1 :
   Load the Energy Consumption dataset through pandas library.
#### Step 2 : 
  Clean the  Energy Consumption dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency and stored the dataframe as a new .csv file.
#### Step 3 :
  Develop a PowerBI  application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Energy Consumption dataset to create interactive plot.
#### Step 4 :
  Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize for orrelations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features like city and year.
